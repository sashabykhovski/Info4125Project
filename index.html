                <p>Welcome to your go-to solution for smart cooking ideas to save money on groceries and minimize food waste! Our platform is designed to
                    support college students who are new to cooking and meal planning as they transition into off-campus life. Without the convenience of meal
                    plans, many students find themselves struggling with over-purchasing, food spoilage, and the frustration of unused ingredients. That's
                    where we come in!
